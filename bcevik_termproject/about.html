                <article>
                    <p>
                        With over seven years of experience in the IT industry, I have established myself as a Software Engineer III in Test at Foundation Medicine. My professional journey has been marked by a deep commitment to ensuring software quality and a versatile skill set that spans multiple domains, including Health, Travel, and Telecommunication.
                        I excel in developing and executing comprehensive test cases, harnessing the power of automation to drive efficient and thorough testing processes. My proficiency extends to a spectrum of technical tools and languages, such as Java, Python, SQL, and Selenium, which I expertly wield to build robust testing frameworks. These frameworks, constructed from scratch, are crafted using methodologies like the Page Object Model, Page Factory, Singleton Pattern Design, and integrated with Maven, Java, Selenium WebDriver, JUnit, TestNG, Cucumber, Jenkins, JDBC, and the REST Assured library.
                        In addition to my technical prowess, I have cultivated a profound understanding of Agile development methodologies. This expertise enables me to seamlessly collaborate with agile teams, contributing significantly to iterative and collaborative software development cycles. My analytical acumen and adept problem-solving skills have consistently led to the timely identification and resolution of issues.
                        My work ethic revolves around a steadfast commitment to delivering high-quality software, a commitment that reflects my unwavering dedication to the field and my pride in consistently producing superior results.
