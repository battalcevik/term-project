                    <p>

My proficiency extends to a spectrum of technical tools and languages, such as Java, Python, SQL, and Selenium, which I expertly wield to build robust testing frameworks. These frameworks, constructed from scratch, are crafted using methodologies like the Page Object Model, Page Factory, Singleton Pattern Design, and integrated with Maven, Java, Selenium WebDriver, JUnit, TestNG, Cucumber, Jenkins, JDBC, and the REST Assured library.
                        In addition to my technical prowess, I have cultivated a profound understanding of Agile development methodologies. This expertise enables me to seamlessly collaborate with agile teams, contributing significantly to iterative and collaborative software development cycles. My analytical acumen and adept problem-solving skills have consistently led to the timely identification and resolution of issues.

                        <!-- created extarnal hyperlink  -->
                        I come from the beautiful city of <a href="https://istanbul.goturkiye.com/" target="_blank">Istanbul</a>, Turkey.
                        Istanbul is a vibrant metropolis that bridges Europe and Asia, offering a rich blend of history, culture, and breathtaking architecture. 
                        Nestled strategically along the Bosporus Strait, Istanbul boasts a unique geographical position that has shaped its identity throughout the centuries. 
                        The city is a living testament to the convergence of diverse civilizations, with landmarks like the Hagia Sophia and the Blue Mosque standing as magnificent reminders of its Byzantine and Ottoman past. 
                        The bustling Grand Bazaar and the vibrant Spice Bazaar showcase Istanbul's thriving markets and the fusion of East and West in its culinary offerings. 
                        As you wander through the winding streets of the historic neighborhoods, you'll encounter the juxtaposition of ancient traditions and modern influences. 
                        Istanbul's dynamic energy is palpable in its bustling street life, lively entertainment scene, and the ever-present aroma of Turkish coffee. 
                        Whether exploring the historic sites of Sultanahmet, cruising along the Bosporus, or savoring the delectable Turkish cuisine in a traditional meyhane, Istanbul captivates visitors with its timeless charm and the warm hospitality of its people.
